SkrrtBot.py:
The implementation of our bot's functionality is found here. SkrrtBot is modeled after trout_bot and uses
the Stockfish chess engine to simulate moves.

experiment.py:
This script is used to test the win percentage of one bot against another. The script runs 50 trials and
prints how many games out of 50 were won. We are using this script to test our bot against other
reconchess bots.
